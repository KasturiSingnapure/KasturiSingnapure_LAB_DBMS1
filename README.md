The project involves designing and implementing a database schema for an E-commerce website and writing SQL queries to perform various 
data retrieval tasks. The schema consists of several tables such as "supplier," "customer," "category," "product," "supplier_pricing,"
"order," and "rating" to store relevant data. The project's learning objectives include understanding database schema design for 
an E-commerce website and becoming proficient in writing SQL queries that involve concepts like selection, grouping, ordering, joining,
subqueries, and stored procedures.
